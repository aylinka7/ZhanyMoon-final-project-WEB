This project is a real-world web application developed for the educational center “Aalam Kids”. The website is designed for public use and allows users to learn more about the center and its educational offerings. The main target audience of the website is parents who are looking for suitable courses for their children.

The main goal of the project is to provide clear and accessible information about available courses and to simplify the process of submitting applications. Visitors of the website can view the list of courses, read detailed information about each course, and leave an application directly through the website. This helps parents quickly find relevant information and contact the educational center without the need for phone calls or in-person visits.

The project includes an admin panel that is used by the staff of the educational center. Through the admin panel, administrators can view submitted applications, manage them, and delete unnecessary or outdated requests. This functionality makes it easier to organize incoming data and improves the internal workflow of the center.

The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop devices. This is especially important because many parents access websites from their mobile devices. The user interface was designed with bright and friendly colors to clearly reflect that the project is related to children’s education and to create a positive and welcoming impression.

Tailwind CSS was used for styling, which allowed for fast development and consistent design across the entire website. Animations were added to improve user experience and make interactions more engaging and visually appealing. The project also supports multilingual functionality using an internationalization (i18n) solution, allowing the website to be available in three different languages. This makes the platform more accessible to a wider audience.

During the development process, special attention was paid to usability and clarity of the interface. The navigation is simple and intuitive, and all key information is easy to find. The overall design and structure of the website were created to ensure that users can quickly understand the purpose of the platform and easily interact with it.

This project helped to strengthen practical frontend development skills, including building responsive layouts, working with translations, creating user-friendly interfaces, and developing an admin panel for data management. Artificial intelligence tools, such as Grok, were used as a supporting resource during development to assist with problem-solving and idea generation.

As a result, a functional and visually appealing website was created for the educational center “Aalam Kids”. The project successfully meets real user needs and demonstrates the ability to develop a complete frontend solution for a real client. In the future, the project can be further improved by adding features such as advanced filtering of courses, application status tracking, and extended admin functionality.
